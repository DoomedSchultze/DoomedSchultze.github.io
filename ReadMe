This is intended as a fun thing for me and my friends, which is why it's a straight rip from Heardle. 
Definitely support the developer(s) of Heardle, as that site is amazing!

I don't intend on publishing this outside of my friend group (as it is just a straight
rip as previously mentioned), but hosting it with Github pages is the easiest way for us to use this.
